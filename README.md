# YelpDatasetChallenge
School Project for Intro Database Class.

This application is built on a C# WPF application. The application is populated with information from a PostgreSQL database. 
The goal of this project is to have something similar to a Yelp app. Users can login with their unique id,
leave reviews for businesses, look at reviews others have left, lookup businesses by hours they are open,
location, rating, etc..
Bing Maps API was also implemented to allow users to view a map of all businesses returned by a certain query.
